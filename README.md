# UniStats: University Programs Analysis & Visualization

With so many universities in the United States, and so many programs within those universities, it can be difficult to find which programs have the most potential for the future. It can also be difficult to know which programs need more support and advertisement. Having a well-presented, interactive summary of how university programs are spread across the United States can be beneficial when making decisions about where (and how much) educational spending should be allocated by universities and the government for each program.

UniStats is FOR universities and government agencies WHO see potential in different university programs that need funding. THE UniStats project is a web-based dashboard THAT displays different visualizations about the statistics of college programs in the United States. UNLIKE any other university funding report, OUR product will provide comprehensive and interactive visualizations that will help the users better understand how different programs are spread across the US.
